# **📜 DM Journal (D\&D Game Master Journal)**

## **About the Project**

This project is a digital journal specifically designed for a Dungeon Master (DM) to manage records and information within a Dungeons & Dragons campaign.  
The main goal is to create a tool that is **convenient and fast to update**, and which launches easily in **any external or in-game browser**. This structure allows the DM to easily craft an interesting narrator character—the journal itself.

## **🛠️ Technologies**

The project is built on a modern stack chosen for performance, component-based architecture, and development convenience:

* **React**: A component-based framework for building the UI.  
  * *Rationale:* Chosen due to the need for **more complex logic and data as the interface foundation**, where React's component approach is more effective than simpler solutions like Alpine.js.  
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework.  
  * *Rationale:* Provides extremely **fast styling**, integrates perfectly with React, and reduces the need for external CSS files.  
* **Vite**: A build tool and development server.  
  * *Rationale:* Selected as an **"out-of-the-box"** solution to ensure quick and convenient build times.
